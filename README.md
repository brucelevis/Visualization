# Visualization
Visualizes simple game techniques for 2D.<br>
Although everything is made for 2D, some techniques can be expanded to 3D (i.e. QuadTree to OcTree or 3D flocking with additional axis)

## Engine & Language
Cocos2d-X 3.13
C++

## Platform
Win32
OSX(Planned)
Linux(Planned)

## Features
### QuadTree
Visualizes 2D space collisions with quad tree. Optimizes number of collision comparison significantly than a bruteforce method (O(N^2)).<br>

**In Progress**
### Flocking
Visualizes 2D space boids flocking with flocking algorithm
